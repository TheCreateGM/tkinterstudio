# Screenshots Directory

This directory should contain the following screenshots for the TkinterStudio documentation:

1. `welcome_screen.png` - The modern welcome screen with recent projects and resources
2. `ide_interface.png` - Main IDE interface showing code editor, solution explorer, and Windows Forms-style toolbox
3. `form_designer.png` - Windows Forms-style designer view with toolbox, property grid, and resize handles
4. `generated_code.png` - Code view showing automatically generated code from the form designer
5. `winforms_example.png` - Example of a Windows Forms-style application created with the designer
6. `property_editor.png` - The modern VS2010-style property editor dialog

To create these screenshots:
1. Run the TkinterStudio application
2. Take screenshots of the different views and features
3. Save them with the filenames listed above
4. Place them in this directory

For the Windows Forms example, open and run the examples/winforms_style.py file.
For the welcome screen, it will appear on startup (or you can run welcome.py directly).
For the property editor, double-click on a property in the Properties panel.

The screenshots will be automatically displayed in the README.md documentation.
